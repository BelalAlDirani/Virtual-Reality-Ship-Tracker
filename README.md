# Maritime: Ship Tracker in VR

Maritime: Tracker in VR is a Virtual Reality app that has been developed to visualise a range of AIS data including ship positions, static and dynamic voyages and historical movements. The application will be used for tracking purposes and can be accessed by users on Android devices with a Virtual Reality (VR) headset. The user is able to select a scenario from a playlist to view. While viewing a scenario a user can view ships, their AIS Data and the ship's present and historical movements. The application connects the device to the web server and retrieves AIS data to display the ships in the chosen playlist and scene.
